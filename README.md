SQL Guided Practice

In this proejct we explored a database from mintclassics who has multiple product lines and sales reps as employees. The issue they present us with is low sell through rates for their product, and we have to identify potential fixes for this issue.

Goals:

1. Calculate inventory available as inventory shortage by product
2. Sales by employee and customer to identify outliers
3. Sales to inventory to compare largest contributors to stagnant sell through rate
4. Analyze product by warehouse to identify warehouses with excess inventory
5. Sort payment amounts to compare customers with most billing activity
6. Compare difference for credit limit and total purchased by customer

Steps
Practice formatting SQL queries in MYSQL workbench and upload to github for portfolio.
Utilized EER for blueprint and code from https://munzirarsyuddin.medium.com/data-analysis-for-inventory-optimization-at-mint-classics-385096e64e76
Copied queries from guided tutorial and used error reports to fix issues.
